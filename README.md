the project is to develop an online multiplayer board game called "Conquest of Stacks." This project primarily aims to provide entertainment and engagement to players, offering a strategic and competitive gaming experience. It doesn't necessarily solve a specific problem but rather focuses on creating an enjoyable gaming environment.

The game explores the concept of strategic gameplay, where players compete to own stacks and accumulate points. It incorporates elements of chance through dice rolls and introduces excitement through event cards that add twists and unpredictability to the gameplay. Additionally, the project explores the use of WebSocket technology to enable turn-based gameplay in an online multiplayer setting, allowing players to compete against each other in real-time.

"Conquest of Stacks" is not part of a larger workplace or business application but is designed primarily for leisure and entertainment. It offers players the opportunity to strategize, compete, and have fun in a virtual board game setting, emphasizing the importance of timing and strategy in making decisions during gameplay.
